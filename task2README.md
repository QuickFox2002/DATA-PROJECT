# Task 2: Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This task involves segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques (K-means). The goal is to understand customer groups and create strategies for targeted marketing.

## Steps:
1. **Load the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (`mall_customers.csv`).
2. **Feature Selection**: Use features like `Annual Income` and `Spending Score` to segment customers.
3. **Apply K-Means Clustering**: Group customers into clusters based on their purchasing behavior.
4. **Visualize Clusters**: Create a scatter plot to visualize the clusters.
5. **Interpretation**: Identify characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., high income, high spending).
