🔑 Steps

Load dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Train-test split (80/20).

Standardize features using StandardScaler.

Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Evaluate models using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC curve

📊 Outcome

Comparison between Logistic Regression & Random Forest.

Performance metrics and ROC-AUC plots.

Random Forest generally performs better on this dataset.
