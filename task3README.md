# Task 3: House Price Prediction

## Overview
This task involves building a regression model to predict house prices based on various features like number of rooms, size, and location. The goal is to train models and evaluate their performance.

## Steps:
1. **Load the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (`house_prices.csv`).
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Train two regression models (Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor).
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. **User Input**: Allow user input for house features and predict the house price.

## Requirements:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation
Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
